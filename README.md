# Student-Performance-Prediction-and-Analysis-for-low-resource-scenario

Analysing the perfomance of students is important
to understand them better. Developing softwares on 
Student Performance Prediction helps in knowing the
inclination of students and therefore will help 
them in deciding their future career. Softwares,
which try to identify the reason for a student's
low performance may help in preventing students
from losing their interest in their studies.

We have used the dataset, which was gathered from 
two portugese schools focussing on the portugese
language.

It is true that the marks in exams taken throughout
the year play a vital role in estimating the
performance of a student. But we wanted to understand
the impact of other factors on the performance of the
students. Factors like family income, extracurricular
activities, parent's education level, illness and 
distance from school can have a major impact on a
student's performance.

We have created 8 models. We have combined different
ml algorithms in pairs to get the best results.
The techniques were applied in following permutations:
i) Dataset with grades and dataset without grades.
ii) Regression (0-20) and 4-level classification

We had reviewed 2 research papers, which mostly 
focused only on grades for determining the performance
of a student.
